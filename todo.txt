bugs:
- if theres extensions, and more energy than can be regened, creep cant be spawned cause of total > current energy
- if ruin is empty, collector gets stuck without changing target (check if target is empty in state switch)

to-do:
- builders repairing
- non-carrier collectors collect from storage/containers
- carriers transfer into storage
- repairer role?
